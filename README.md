A pythonic implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Unlike the classic Game of Life,
where cells interact solely with their immediate neighbors, this version introduces the concept of non-local interaction. Cells
that are seemingly distant from each other can now become neighbors by virtue of being connected through a wormhole.
